# ****************  REQUIRED VARIABLES  ****************
# These required variables' values MUST be provided by the User
#
# NOTE: For Terraform Cloud/Enterprise these variables should be defined
#       in the workspace in terraform cloud/enterprise as a terraform variable
#
#       You also need to define: GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS as an environment
#       variable.
# prefix         = "<prefix-value>"
# location       = "<gcp-zone-or-region>" # e.g., "us-east1-b"
# project        = "<gcp-project>"
# ssh_public_key = "<ssh-public-key>"
# ****************  REQUIRED VARIABLES  ****************

#
# !NOTE! - Without specifying your CIDR block access rules, ingress traffic
#          to your cluster will be blocked by default.
#
# If you need to add your own public ip, use `curl -s ifconfig.me` 
# and append "/32", e.g. 1.2.3.4/32 to create a valid CIDR for use.
#
# !NOTE! - When using Terraform Cloud you must set your access_cidrs to ["0.0.0.0/0"]
#          in order to work. They do not publish their 'helper' agent IPs or assign those
#          per account so no way to predict those values when setting up access CIDRs.
