Terraform input variables can be set in the following ways:
- Individually, with the [-var command line option](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variables-on-the-command-line).
- In [variable definitions (.tfvars) files](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-definitions-tfvars-files). We recommend this way for most variables.
- As [environment variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#environment-variables).

## Required Variables

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| prefix | A prefix used in the name of all the Google Cloud resources created by this script. | string | | The prefix string must start with a lowercase letter and contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes (-), but cannot end with a dash. |
| location | The Google Cloud Region (for example "us-east1") or Google Cloud Zone (for example "us-east1-b") to provision all resources in this script. | string | | See [this topic](user/Locations.md) on how to chose a region or a zone.  |
| project | The ID of the Google Cloud Project to use | string | | |
| service_account_keyfile | Filename of the Service Account JSON file | string | Not required when running on a Google Cloud VM that is associated with the Service Account |

## Google Cloud Authentication

The Terraform process manages Google Cloud resources on your behalf. In order to do so, it needs to know the credentials for a Google Cloud identity with the required permissions.

For more detailed information on what is needed see [Authenticating Terraform to access Google Cloud](https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-iac-gcp/blob/main/docs/user/TerraformGCPAuthentication.md)

## Admin Access

By default, the API of the Google Cloud resources that are being created are only accessible through authenticated Google Cloud clients (e.g. the Google Cloud Portal, the `gcloud` CLI, the Google Cloud Shell, etc.)
To allow access for other administrative client applications (for example `kubectl`, `psql`, etc.), you need to open up the Google Cloud firewall to allow access from your source IPs.

To do set these permissions as part of this Terraform script, specify ranges of IP addresses in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing). Contact your Network Administrator to find the public CIDR range of your network.

You can use `default_public_access_cidrs` to set a default range for all created resources. To set different ranges for other resources, define the appropriate variable. Use and empty list `[]` to disallow access explicitly.

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Notes |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| default_public_access_cidrs | IP Ranges allowed to access all created cloud resources | list of strings | | Set a default for all Resources |
| cluster_endpoint_public_access_cidrs | IP Ranges allowed to access the GKE cluster api | list of strings | | for client admin access to the cluster, e.g. with `kubectl`. |
| vm_public_access_cidrs | IP Ranges allowed to access the VMs | list of strings | | Opens port 22 for SSH access to the jump server and/or NFS VM. Only used with `create_jump_public_ip=true` or `create_nfs_public_ip=true`. |
| postgres_public_access_cidrs | IP Ranges allowed to access the Google Cloud PostgreSQL Server | list of strings ||Opens port 5432. Only used when creating postgres instances.|

| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| gke_subnet_cidr | Address space for the subnet for the GKE resources | string | "192.168.0.0/23" | This variable is ignored when `vpc_name` is set (aka bring your own vnet) |
| gke_pod_subnet_cidr | Secondary address space in the GKE subnet for Kubernetes Pods | string | "10.0.0.0/17" | This variable is ignored when `subnet_names` is set (aka bring your own subnets) |

### Use Existing

If desired, you can deploy into an existing VPC, use existing subnets, and provide an existing Cloud NAT IP address. You will need a private subnet for the GKE nodes and a public subnet for the Jump VM and (if used) the NFS VM. The GKE subnet requires two secondary CIDR ranges for the Kubernetes Pods and Services (see https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/alias-ips#cluster_sizing).

The existing subnets need to match the same region given in the `location` variable defined [here](#required-variables)

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Notes |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| vpc_name | Name of pre-existing VPC | string | null | Only required if deploying into existing VPC |
| subnet_names | Existing subnets/secondary ranges mapped to desired usage | map(string) | null | Only required if deploying into existing subnets. See example below |
| nat_address_name | Name of existing IP address for existing Cloud NAT | string | null | If not given, a Cloud NAT and associated external IP will be created |

Example `subnet_names` variable:

```yaml
subnet_names = {
  ## Required subnet/range names
  "gke"                     = "name_of_my_gke_subnet"
  "gke_pods_range_name"     = "name_of_my_secondary_range_for_pods"
  "gke_services_range_name" = "name_of_my_secondary_range_for_services"
  "misc"                    = "name_of_my_misc_subnet"
}
```

Note: The subnets for filestore and database can not the pre-created. Google Cloud creates the subnets as part of the services.

## General

The application of a Kubernetes version in Google Cloud has some limitations when assigning channels and versions to the cluster. The documentation that describes these limitations can be found in the [Kubernetes Versions](user/KubernetesVersions.md) guide.

## Postgres Servers

When setting up ***external database servers***, you must provide information about those servers in the `postgres_servers` variable block. Each entry in the variable block represents a ***single database server***.

This code only configures database servers. No databases are created during the infrastructure setup.

The variable has the following format:

```terraform
postgres_servers = {
  default = {},
  ...
}
```

**NOTE**: The `default = {}` elements is always required when creating external databases. This is the systems default database server.

Each server element, like `foo = {}`, can contain none, some, or all of the parameters listed below. The `machine_type` and `edition` parameters must be explicitly specified and will be validated based on the `server_version`:

- For PostgreSQL 16+:
  - `edition` must be `"ENTERPRISE_PLUS"`
  - `machine_type` must start with `"db-perf-optimized-N-"`
- For PostgreSQL < 16:
  - `edition` must be `"ENTERPRISE"`
  - `machine_type` must start with `"db-custom-"`

*NOTE*: The default = {} elements is always required when creating external databases. This is the systems default database server.

If you provide an empty block for default, the following default values will be used:
terraform
postgres_servers = {
  default = {
    server_version = "15"
    edition        = "ENTERPRISE"
    machine_type   = "db-custom-4-16384"
  }
}

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Notes |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| machine_type| The machine type for the PostgreSQL server VMs" | string | "db-custom-4-16384" | Google Cloud Postgres supports only shared-core machine types such as db-f1-micro, and custom machine types such as db-custom-2-13312. Must match the PostgreSQL version requirements. |
| edition | Cloud SQL edition type | string | "ENTERPRISE" | Must be `"ENTERPRISE"` for PostgreSQL < 16 or `"ENTERPRISE_PLUS"` for PostgreSQL 16+. |
| storage_gb | Minimum storage allowed for the PostgreSQL server | number | 128 | |
| backups_enabled | Enables postgres backups | bool | true | |

| administrator_password | The Password associated with the administrator_login for the PostgreSQL Server | string | "my$up3rS3cretPassw0rd" |  |
| server_version | The version of the  PostgreSQL server instance | string | "15" | Refer to the [SAS Viya Platform Administration Guide](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=itopssr&docsetTarget=p05lfgkwib3zxbn1t6nyihexp12n.htm#p1wq8ouke3c6ixn1la636df9oa1u) for the supported versions of PostgreSQL for the SAS Viya platform. |
| ssl_enforcement_enabled | Enforce SSL on connection to the PostgreSQL database | bool | true | |
| availability_type | The availability type for the primary instance. | string | "ZONAL" | This is only used to set up high availability for the PostgreSQL instance. Can be either `ZONAL` or `REGIONAL`. |
| database_flags | Database flags for the primary instance. | list(object({})) |  | More details can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/flags) |

Multiple SAS offerings require a second PostgreSQL instance referred to as SAS Common Data Store, or CDS PostgreSQL. For more information, see [Common Customizations](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=itopscdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=dplyml0phy0dkr&docsetTarget=n08u2yg8tdkb4jn18u8zsi6yfv3d.htm#p0wkxxi9s38zbzn19ukjjaxsc0kl). A list of SAS offerings that require CDS PostgreSQL is provided in [SAS Common Data Store Requirements](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=itopscdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=itopssr&docsetTarget=p05lfgkwib3zxbn1t6nyihexp12n.htm#n03wzanutmc6gon1val5fykas9aa). To create and configure an external CDS PostgreSQL instance in addition to the external platform PostgreSQL instance named `default`, specify `cds-postgres` as a second PostgreSQL instance, as shown in the example below.

Here is an example of the `postgres_servers` variable with the `default` server entry and the `cds-postgres` entry, both with explicit edition and machine type configurations that match their PostgreSQL versions:

```terraform
postgres_servers = {
  default = {
    administrator_password       = "D0ntL00kTh1sWay"
    server_version              = "16"  # PostgreSQL 16
    machine_type                = "db-perf-optimized-N-8"  # Required for PostgreSQL 16+
    edition                     = "ENTERPRISE_PLUS"  # Required for PostgreSQL 16+
  },
  cds-postgres = {
    machine_type                           = "db-custom-4-16384"  # Required for PostgreSQL < 16
    storage_gb                             = 128
    backups_enabled                        = true
    backups_start_time                     = "21:00"
    backups_location                       = null
    backups_point_in_time_recovery_enabled = false
    backup_count                           = 7 # Number of backups to retain, not in days
    administrator_login                    = "cdsadmin"
    administrator_password                 = "my$up3rS3cretPassw0rd"
    server_version                         = "15"  # PostgreSQL 15
    edition                                = "ENTERPRISE"  # Required for PostgreSQL < 16
    availability_type                      = "ZONAL"
    ssl_enforcement_enabled                = true
    database_flags                         = [{ name = "cloudsql.enable_pg_cron", value = "true"}, { name = "cloudsql.enable_pgaudit", value = "true"}]
